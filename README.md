# RotorHazard OBS Websocks Control Plugin
This system allows RotorHazard to communicate to [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) video application and control the video remotely. The Rotohazard "start race" and "stop race" events will start and stop the video recording automatically.

This software is distributed as a plugin to be added to the RotorHazard.

## Features
* Start/Stop OBS recording at every race.
* Star recording before race starts (parameter in milliseconds).
* Restart connection to OBS in case of a failed call to the Webservice.
* A start/stop recording failure raisesÂ a high-priority message in the front end.

## USE CASES
* Control OBS Studio to save race video.
* Start recording before the race ( helps detect false starts )
* Record Video on multiple machines simultaneously. To bypass machine limitations.  (TODO)
